                    <h3>Project Goal</h3>
                    The project highlights the function of traffic in Seattle. 
                    The target audience of this project is the people of Seattle, 
                    especially commuters. Therefore, the intended audience most 
                    likely already have a good understanding that traffic in big 
                    cities can be congested and plays a big role in the commutes of 
                    those living in the city. As a result, the intended audience 
                    also is aware that gas can be pretty expensive, and there are 
                    significant environmental effects from large amounts of vehicle 
                    commuters. This project shows exactly how these things are 
                    occurring, utilizing both historical data to analyze traffic 
                    trends and year-to-date differences, as well as real-time data 
                    that can be utilized by the average person to know where the 
                    current most congested areas are.

                    In general, there has been a bigger push to lean more
                      towards public transport and shift away from the car dependency
                       that the US has, and this project fits into that as the issue
                        of intense city traffic is alleviated as more public 
                        transportation and infrastructure is implemented.
                         One issue that has occurred from that is the placement
                          of public transport stations. There is a proposed link
                           station in the International District of Seattle that
                            would displace long-standing businesses in the area.
                             So, vulnerable areas without much of a voice can be
                              left damaged as we push more towards changes in
                               how transportation is working. As such, it is 
                               important to consider how we continue to shift 
                               to a more sustainable transportation future in 
                               cities, as we want to preserve the areas of 
                               importance to the people living there.
